Moto Craft 3D - Pro Edition

A high-octane, Minecraft-inspired 3D motorcycle stunt game built with Three.js. Navigate through procedurally generated voxel worlds, dodge swinging hammers, jump over lava pits, and reach the finish line across multiple difficulty levels.

🎮 Key Features

Procedural Voxel Worlds: Endless terrain generation with different themes (Grasslands, Dusty Dunes, Void Canyon).

Physics-Based Stunts: Realistic bike movement including gravity, suspension (squash and stretch), and air rotation.

Dynamic Hazards:

Swinging Hammers: Overhead hazards that test your timing.

Rolling Spike Balls: Hazards that follow the terrain path.

Clock Bell Pendulums: Large swinging blocks placed in challenging sections.

Lava Gaps: Large pits that require precise jumping.

Checkpoint System: Reach flags to save your progress. Fair-spawn logic ensures no hazards are too close to your respawn point.

Level Progression: Difficulty scales from Easy to Extreme, increasing hazard speed and frequency.
